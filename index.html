<h1>Kathryn Mayer</h1>
<p>
    This assignment was difficult as I didn't know where to go at first. <br>
    After finding the right help it became increasingly more fun and I <br>
    was able to gain a better understanding. <b>Coding</b> can be tricky<br>
    but it's also a lot of <em>fun</em>! Most of all I'd like to continue<br>
    to learn in a way that helps me to build beautiful things. This may <br>
    not be beautiful but it's doing the job and I'll take a win on that.<br>
    The greatest quote my sister shared was, "it's like jumping into a <br>
    new language; confusing at first but eventually we'll be speaking it."
