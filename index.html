    <p>This assignment was difficult as I didn't know where to go at first. 
        After finding the right help it became increasingly more fun and I 
        was able to gain a better understanding. <strong>Coding</strong> can be tricky
        but it's also a lot of <em>fun</em>! Most of all I'd like to continue
        to learn in a way that helps me to build beautiful things. This may 
        not be beautiful but it's doing the job and I'll take a win on that.
        The greatest quote my sister shared was, "it's like jumping into a 
        new language; confusing at first but eventually we'll be speaking it."</p>
