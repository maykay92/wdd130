        <p>My idea is to raise awareness to huskies. The goal of the website would be to create a place that others may go to find which of this particular breed is in need of a home. We live in a world where a lot of animals end up without shelter and on the street. Have you heard of the term 'adopt, don't shop'? Well, I want to bring more awareness to exactly that. Though they are a high energy dog, they need a chance to be in a loving environment just like any other. Yet they are one of the most discarded breeds out there. My two took patience and dedication but they were worth it. So, I hope to encourage everyone to check out this site before they make their next decision of bringing a dog into their home.</p>
