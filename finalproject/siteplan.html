        <h3>Site Name</h3>
        <p>Dakota's Rescue</p>
        <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to provide an awareness to the husky breed.
        The goal would be to create a place that others may go to find which of this
        particular breed is in need of a home. Since this is one of the most discarded
        breeds, the point of this site is to bring resources together so that these    
        dogs can find a home and feel a part of a family. We live in a world where 
        a lot of animals end up without shelter or on the street. I want to bring more
        awareness to the term 'adopt, don't shop.' Though they are a high energy dog,
        they need a chance to be in a loving enviornment just like any other. I hope to
        encourage everyone to check out this site before they make their next decision 
        of bringing a dog into their home. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
            This site targets a wide variety of audiences including, though not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>A new family looking to adopt a rescue.</li> 
                <li>The adventurer looking for a companion to hit the trails with them. </li>
                <li>A home with an anxious dog who needs a friend to play out some of that
                    high energy. </li>
                <li>For those who want a wolf looking breed without the maintainance of a wolf.
                </li>
            </ul>
