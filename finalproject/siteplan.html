        <h3>Site Name</h3>
        <p>Dakota's Rescue</p>
        <h3>Site Map</h3>
        <p>Home page, Adopting Information, Contact Page</p>
        <p>People will come to this site to experience the breed of a 
            husky or malamute. We will offer different selections of 
            who is available for adoption and post information about 
            each dog. Then under the information will be additional 
            material about the dog itself; its temperament, behavior 
            with children or other pets, etc. There will also be a 
            section written about how this organization came to be - 
            with a small -about me- narrating what drove the purpose 
            of the rescue.  </p>

            <p>There will be a document to fill out for adoption 
                screening and a place to put through payment for rehoming 
                fee. People will come to this site because there will be 
                information about the breed and what they have to offer. 
                We will showcase their strengths while educating the 
                audience on how to deal with a breed that requires so 
                much attention and energy. They are a very intelligent 
                breed and need lots of stimulation so I will provide as 
                much detail in order to give these dogs a good home.
            </p>
        <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to provide an awareness to the husky breed.
        The goal would be to create a place that others may go to find which of this
        particular breed is in need of a home. Since this is one of the most discarded
        breeds, the point of this site is to bring resources together so that these    
        dogs can find a home and feel a part of a family. We live in a world where 
        a lot of animals end up without shelter or on the street. I want to bring more
        awareness to the term 'adopt, don't shop.' Though they are a high energy dog,
        they need a chance to be in a loving enviornment just like any other. I hope to
        encourage everyone to check out this site before they make their next decision 
        of bringing a dog into their home. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
            This site targets a wide variety of audiences including, though not limited to:

                <li>A home with an anxious dog who needs a friend to play out some of that
                    high energy. </li>
